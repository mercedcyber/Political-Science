## Syllabus 
This course provides an introduction to the field of political psychology.  Political psychologists have applied insights of psychological science to a host of research questions relating to mass political behavior.  In this course we will sample from across this broad range of topics in order to discover what ordinary people think and feel about politics. <br>
Questions we will explore include: How do citizens organize their thoughts on politics?  How do emotions influence political decision-making?  What considerations go in to citizens’ racial attitudes and tolerance judgments?  Do the media exert a strong influence on how citizens think about politics? <br> 
In order to understand the key concepts in political psychology we will read research in its original form, assess newer and synthesis works, and delve into the mechanics of original survey research.  Students will have the opportunity to work in teams and also produce individual work.
